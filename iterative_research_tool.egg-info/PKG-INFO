# Multi-Agent Advisory Planner CLI Tool

A powerful command-line tool for strategic planning and decision-making using multi-agent panels with diverse cognitive perspectives.

## Features

- **Multiple Advisory Panels**: Choose from specialized panels including Cognitive Diversity, Decision Intelligence, and Future Scenarios
- **Time Travel**: Rewind to previous states and explore alternative paths
- **Stateful Memory**: Maintains context across sessions to build a user profile
- **Visualization**: Rich terminal visualizations for agent interactions and outputs
- **Feedback Collection**: Gather and incorporate user feedback to improve future recommendations

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research_cli_tool.git
cd research_cli_tool

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Run with the default cognitive diversity panel
iterative-research "What strategic approach should I take for expanding my business internationally?"

# Run with a specific panel
iterative-research --panel decision-intelligence "Should I invest in new technology or optimize existing processes?"

# Run with future scenarios panel
iterative-research --panel future-scenarios "How might climate change affect my supply chain over the next decade?"
```

### Available Panels

- `cognitive-diversity`: Analyzes problems from multiple cognitive perspectives (systems thinking, first principles, contrarian, creative, and pragmatic)
- `decision-intelligence`: Provides structured decision support (problem framing, options generation, evidence analysis, consequence forecasting, and decision evaluation)
- `future-scenarios`: Explores potential futures and their implications (trend analysis, uncertainty mapping, scenario building, implication analysis, and robust strategy)

### Time Travel

```bash
# Start a new planning session
iterative-research "What's the best approach for digital transformation?"

# Rewind to a previous checkpoint
iterative-research --time-travel initial

# Explore an alternative approach
iterative-research --alternative "What's the best approach for digital transformation with limited resources?"
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in your home directory with the following:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Advanced Features

### User Memory

The tool maintains a user profile based on your interactions, which helps provide more personalized recommendations over time. Your profile is stored locally at `~/.config/iterative_research_tool/user_memory.json`.

### Output Storage

All planning sessions are saved to `~/iterative_research_tool_output/` for future reference.
