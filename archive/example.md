# Artificial Intelligence: An Overview

## Introduction

Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.

## History of AI

The field of AI research was founded at a workshop held on the Dartmouth College campus in 1956. The attendees became the leaders of AI research for decades.

## Types of AI

### Narrow AI

Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed and trained for a particular task. Virtual personal assistants, such as Apple's Siri, are a form of narrow AI.

### General AI

General AI, also known as Strong AI, is a type of intelligence that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence.

## Applications of AI

AI has been applied in various fields including healthcare, finance, and transportation.

## Ethical Considerations

The development of AI raises ethical concerns related to privacy, bias, and the potential for autonomous weapons.
