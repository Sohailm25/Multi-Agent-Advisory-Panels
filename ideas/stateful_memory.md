Stateful Memory Management
Persistent Strategic Context
LangGraph's state management capabilities enable maintaining a rich, persistent knowledge base about the user across sessions:

Record goals, commitments, and challenges

Track which approaches have been effective

Identify recurring patterns in user behavior

Store previous advice and user-reported outcomes

This creates a truly personalized experience that evolves with the user rather than starting from scratch each time.

Time Travel and Alternative Exploration
Implement LangGraph's time travel feature to enable powerful strategic exploration:

# Command: iterative-research strategic-planner --rewind 3 "What if I tried a different approach?"
This would allow users to explore alternative strategic paths without losing their current trajectory. The system could maintain multiple potential strategies in parallel and compare outcomes.
